## üóíÔ∏è Usage

After running from the first time the program will tell you that you haven't specified an API key  
You can specify this key by going to your config folder:  
- `~/.config/ask_config` in Linux
- `C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming` in Windows
- `/Users/username/Library/Application Support`

And add the following to the `config.toml` file:  
`GEMINI_TOKEN=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`  
Alternatively you can pass your API key as an environment variable by executing:  
`export GEMINI_TOKEN=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`  

```sh
Usage: ask-cli [OPTIONS] --prompt <PROMPT>

Options:
  -t, --shell <SHELL>    
        Specify the shell used when running with the execute option
  -x, --execute          
        Ask the AI to provide you with just a command and then ask you to execute it
  -s, --system <SYSTEM>  
        Specify an optional system prompt to change the AI generation results
  -p, --prompt <PROMPT>  
        The prompt that the AI will respond to
  -h, --help             Print help
  -V, --version          Print version
```
